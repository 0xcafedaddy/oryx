At last! The first alpha release of Oryx 2 is now available.

Oryx 2 is a realization of the lambda architecture built on Apache Spark and Apache Kafka, but with specialization for real-time large scale machine learning. It is a framework for building applications, but also includes packaged, end-to-end applications for collaborative filtering, classification, regression and clustering.
